An Apple Silicon Mac running macOS 12+ is required. This image has Rosetta pre-configured along with amd64 multiarch support installed. To install x86_64 packages, append `:amd64` to the name. For example:

```
$ sudo apt install hello:amd64
```

Note that Rosetta does not currently support i386 packages so that multiarch is not enabled.
