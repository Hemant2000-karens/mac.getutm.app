This UTM package runs **Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger** for **PowerPC (PPC64)** architecture.

üß∞ **Pre-configured** with:
- Bootable Tiger installer disk
- Apple Partition Table disk (required for Tiger installation)
- Compatible QEMU config for PPC emulation

üí° **Usage Note**:
Due to Tiger's age, this is best suited for retro software exploration, classic Mac apps, and nostalgia! It's not intended for modern productivity use.

‚ö†Ô∏è Runs **only on macOS hosts via UTM**, and can be slower due to QEMU emulation of PPC. Allocate at least **512 MB RAM** and **10 GB Disk**.

üì• Download the `.utm.zip` and import into UTM to get started.
